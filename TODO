Terraform

- The terraform configuration is filled with `TODO:`s and `FIXME:`s that
  documents the next steps to take to update the configuration.
- reorganize the resources in modules, general resource renaming
- Some information are replicated between Github actions env var, terraform
  cloud env var, Hardcoded in Github workflows, hardcode in the terraform
  configuration or hardcoded in the backend/frontend build tools (like backend
  build path). Find a way to reorganize those with a single source of truth
  (likely github env vars).
