Terraform
- Up to now we have only the shared-module deployed. In .github/workflow-wip
there is the work in progress update to the terraform action to deploy also the shared module
- Define the shared resources that have been deployed manually
- Move some resources from dependent modules to shared module (like api-gateway)
- Automate dns CNAME record creation, up to now terraform fails to connect to cloudflare
- Solve auth problem with OICD in AWS (actually using credentials)

AWS
- Correctly setup the dns to link it with api-gateway
- Make the gradle build more precise and efficient, and define a lambda layer.
