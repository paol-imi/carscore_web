# Set up Github repo

## Create an OpenID Connect Identity provider

The first step is to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider in your AWS Account. This will allow Github to identify itself.

- Got to the IAM console -> Identity providers
- Click Add new provider
- Select OpenID Connect
- Provider Url: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com (Don't forget to click Get Thumbprint)
- Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
- Add tags if you want to and click Add Provider

## Create a role

You now need to create a role that Github will be able to assume in order to access the resources it needs to control.

- Go back to IAM and select Roles
- Create a new Role
- Chose Web Identity, select the Identity provider you created in the previous step, and its audience.
- Click Next:Permissions

### Permission policies

You now need to give the role the appropriate permissions (Policies). These are the ones that Github needs in order to do whatever it has to do. This will vary based on your use case, so I will leave that up to you. Keep in mind that you should stick to the principle of least privileges.

When that is done, give your role a name and click Create Role.

There is now an additional step to do. You need to edit the trust policy of the role to reduce its scope to your repository only. Make sure you don't skip this part, it is very important. Without that, any repository on GitHub will be able to assume your role and access your resources. (Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a way to do that at creation time).

Go back to IAM Roles and select the created Role. Choose Trust Relationships and Edit Trust Relationship.

Under Condition, add the following segment:

```json
"StringLike": {
  "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:[your-org]/[your-repo]:*"
}
```

The final result will look like this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:[your-org]/[your-repo]:*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This concludes the required configurations on your AWS account. Take note of the role ARN, you'll need it later.

### Configure Github action workflow

Your Github workflow requires additional permissions in order to be able to use OIDC. Add the following at the top of your workflow's YML file. You can also add it at the job level to reduce the scope if needed.

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write # required to use OIDC authentication
  contents: read # required to checkout the code from the repo
You can now use the configure-aws-credentials Github action in the job that needs to assume the role. Add this step to generate credentials before doing any call to AWS:
```

```yaml
- name: configure aws credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/your-role-arn
    role-duration-seconds: 900 # the ttl of the session, in seconds.
    aws-region: us-east-1 # use your region here.

# You can now execute commands that use the credentialsðŸ‘‡
- name: Serverless deploy
  run: sls deploy --stage dev
```

The configure AWS credentials step will use the OIDC integration to assume the given role, generate short-lived credentials, and make them available to the current job.

ðŸ’¡ If you want to take security even further, you can also keep your role's ARN used in role-to-assume in a Github secret.
